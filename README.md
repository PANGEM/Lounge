# Vision Statement
“Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted.”

-Martin Luther King Jr.


“Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

-Steve Jobs

When countries are starting trade wars, political wars, and ideological wars, for the few who will benefit, and we see the economy built on such illusions start to falter and crumble. And we see the very financial institutions we are supposed to trust reaping the rewards of the havoc who do we have to turn?

This is for those who see the need for unity in our world, who recognise that we are all a father, a mother, a sister, a brother, a daughter, or a son. For those who recognise that we need a symbol for this unity that is independent from any government or bank. To prove that we have the capacity to survive anything that comes our way as a united world, as humanity.

The vision of PANGEM is to create a global currency not pegged to any currency, that will not be at the mercy of any country or bank. A currency that will not be affected by trade wars, political wars, and ideological wars. It will be a currency that only needs to rely on the global citizens that use it, and itself, to create and sustain its own stable value.

This vision is for the creatively maladjusted, the crazy, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, who understands the need to fight the current status quo of our current world and push the human race forward. Who realise the need for a world currency that is independent of the follies of the few.
